# Design of Algorithms (CSC 2400)

## Description
This project repository contains implementations of key algorithms, including sorting, searching, and graph traversal, completed as part of the Design of Algorithms course at Tennessee Tech University.

The focus of this project is to analyze algorithm efficiency and understand data structures such as trees, hash tables, and graphs. Key algorithms implemented include:
- Merge Sort
- Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm
- Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS)

## Technologies Used
- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: MatPlotLab  
- **Tools**: Git (version control), VSCode  

## Features
- Sorting and searching algorithms for analyzing runtime efficiency
- Graph traversal methods with sample graph representations
- Comparisons of recursive vs. iterative algorithms

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DaltonSloan/DaltonSloan-CSC-2400-Design-of-Algorithms.git
